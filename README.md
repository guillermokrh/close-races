### Contribute to CloseRaces.com!
I created this site after realizing that there was no easy way to donate to the closest House races in the 2016 election.  It's barebones--using a Bootstrap template and HTML.  This was ideal at the time since I was exactly 2 weeks away from election day, and had little time to rig up a database or debug the site.  Think of this site more as a worldwide post-it note than a fully featured app.  Also, this makes the site easy to load!

### Bugs and Issues
Ideas for new features: 
* Get polling data for each candidate from RealClearPolitics or an API that has the latest election polls available.  
* Fix the website's header for the smartphone version of the site.
* Do design tweaks--make sure that the pictures are exactly the same size (some are off right now), paragraphs are centered.
* Create a way to sort the candidates based on state, polling position, underrepresented minorities and genders in government.

### Website Template Credits
I am using the following website template for CloseRaces.com.  I would not have been able to get this site up and running so quickly without this awesome template!
[Heroic Features](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/heroic-features/) is a multipurpose HTML template for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
